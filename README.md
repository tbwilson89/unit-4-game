## Basic Gameplay Rundown
Choose your character, pick your opponent for each round and fight them to victory! But be careful because all choices have the ability to lose as well as win, so the order for which you select your opponents is important!
### Choose your character!
Pick from the selection of characters to be your personal fighter, the remainder of characters will be your opponents!
### Choose your opponents and fight!
Once you've selected your character, you will be able to select from the ones remaining to be your opponent. Once selected you will be able to attack
and defeat them.
### Play Again!
After defeating all opponents or losing to one of them you will be able to try again, either choose a new character for yourself or try again with the same one!
